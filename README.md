# Homework_Dynamic_Collections
Homework in university about dynamic collections.</br>
Exercise 1 - ArrayList</br>
  ➔ Create a class with at least 2 numeric and at least 2 String variables and at least 1 constructor</br>
  ➔ Create at least 5 objects of the created class in the main() method</br>
  ➔ Create an ArrayList and insert the created objects</br>
  ➔ Output the size of the list</br>
  ➔ Create another list with multiple objects of the same class</br>
  ➔ Add second list to first list using addAll() method</br>
  ➔ Print the size of the second list</br>
  ➔ Clear the second list</br>
  ➔ Print the size of the second list</br>
  ➔ In your created object class, create a method that returns a numeric value depending on the object's parameters</br>
  ➔ Iterate through the list created in the first points using the classic 'for' loop with position index and for each object in the list, call the previously created numeric method</br>
  ➔ Using the remove() method, remove the specific object from the list if the method returns a negative number</br>
  ➔ Redefine the object's toString() method</br>
  ➔ Use a 'for' loop of the object type, print each of the objects</br>
  ➔ Create at least 2 additional methods that are called cyclically for each object and their returned result affects the operation of the loop (for example, calculate the sum of all products whose name begins with "Audi")</br>
  ➔ Use at least 3 more ArrayList methods</br>
</br>
Exercise 2 - HashMap</br>
  ➔ Create a class with at least 2 numeric and at least 2 String variables and at least 1 constructor (you can use the class created in exercise 1)</br>
  ➔ Create at least 3 objects in the main() method</br>
  ➔ Create a HashMap, the data type of its keys is your choice. Value data type – the object class created in the previous point</br>
  ➔ Put the created objects into the list</br>
  ➔ Create another list and puts 2 other objects in the list</br>
  ➔ Combine lists using the putAll() method</br>
  ➔ Remove one of the objects from the list by its key</br>
  ➔ Print the size of the list</br>
  ➔ Insert an object into the list with the key it already has</br>
  ➔ Print the size of the list</br>
  ➔ Use the containsKey() and containsValue() methods so that both 'true' and 'false' are returned twice each</br>
  ➔ Iterate through the keys of a list using a 'for' loop of the object type</br>
  ➔ Get a single object from a list by its key</br>
  ➔ Clear the list</br>
